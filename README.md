# Advent of Code

The Advent of Code is something I only learned about in 2024 and is a yearly coding challenge throughout the month of December.

It is structured like an advent calender: each day there are 2 new puzzles to solve getting progressively more difficult as time goes on.

This is my work for all the year's I have completed (which so far is just 2024).
